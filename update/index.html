         <p style="color:black">My name is Rabia Gunonu, and I am a recent graduate of Texas A&M University. I always had an interest towards technology and art which led me to major in Computer Science. I took courses such as Game Development, Graphics, and Human Computer Interaction to learn about graphical techniques as well as technologies applied in those fields. My favorite topics are HCI, Game Development, Information Retrieval and Network Security. I am currently seeking a full-time position as a software developer. I think it is important to work with a team of people where I can learn from because I believe there is always room for improvement. Donâ€™t hesitate to contact me through my contact information if you have any inquiries about my work.</p>

          <p class="lead">We were assigned to a group of four, and given two clients. Our clients were two economics professors and they wanted an application that could help them conduct research on kids. Our group had the chance to see a full life cycle of a product in this project. We made multiple design ideas and chose to develop a database and a game. Our game enabled children to fully immerse themselves in the research and give accurate answers. Database kept records of gameplay data. I developed the game in Unity. The most challenging part was to make the game simple enough for children that are at pre-school level. To do this, I had to make sure there were as little written instructions as possible.</p>

          <p class="lead">In this course, I learned about how to characterize, evaluate and design interfaces. With a group of three, we made a Chrome Extension to enhance user experience for people with visual impairments. It had three features; grayscale, text-to-speech and text enlargement. I implemented text-to-speech functionality which had stop, play and pause options. The user could simply highlight and the highlighted selection would be vocalized by the Alpaca extension.</p>

          <p class="lead">In this course, I learned key concepts and models relevant to information storage and retrieval including: Boolean, vector space and probabilistic models, relevance feedback, clustering and categorization. In a group of three we designed a recommendation application. Our application recommended places to go to based on a few questions asked to the user. I had the most contribution on the design of the application. Our team won the best design award in class. </p>

          <p class="lead">In Game Development, I learned about aesthetic and technical aspects of computer game development including: content creation, interface design, AI, and shader programming. We formed groups of eight and we developed two games using the Unity game engine. For High Noon(first game), I worked on the user interface and this game was very well received in class. M.A.D (second game) had a greater complexity. There was a need for more assets thus for this game I created game assets with another team member. I was also in charge of level design.</p>

          <p class="lead"> Graphics: This class was very hard but I learned a lot from it. All projects were individual projects done on Visual Studio using OpenGL. The image I have shared is an image of the ray tracing project I did. </p>
          <p class="lead"> Parallel Computing: This course was definitely out of my comfort zone because it was very different compared to all of my previous courses. I had to use a super computer and optimize code using different techniques.</p>
          <p class="lead"> Personal Project: Recently made a restaurant suggestion app. It uses Zomato API to suggest top five restaurants based on the amount of money user wants to spend and zipcode of the user. The second images I shared are the main two pages of this website.</p>
